What is SpeedBridge?
---

**SpeedBridge** is a bridging plugin that lets your players score a timestamp by bridging from A to B as fast as possible. This is for people who would want to train their bridging skills, experiment with other bridging techniques, or play competitively and gain a spot on the leaderboard.
