I spent a full week working on this plugin for our fellow members, I'd like to shout out to Eben for suggesting this idea & helping me along the way to get it stable as it is.

**SpeedBridge** is a bridging plugin that lets your players score a timestamp by bridging from A to B as fast as possible. This is for people who would want to train their bridging skills, experiment with other bridging techniques or play competitively and gain a spot on the leaderboard.

You can also check the live version (whose not operated/hosted by me) at **Squidical.net**.

## API
On v2.0.0 version and above, There is API Support but it's unstable so be careful.
